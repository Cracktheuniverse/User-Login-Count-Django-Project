    <p>Cinema of South India, refers to the cinema of the four major film industries in South India; primarily engaged in making feature films in the four major languages of the region, namely â€” Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. 
        They are often colloquially referred to as Kollywood, Tollywood, Sandalwood and Mollywood.
    </p>
    <p> Although the four industries developed independently for a long period of time, gross exchange of artists and technicians, as well as globalisation helped to shape this new identity.[1] By 2010.
        South India became the home for 6320, or about 62 of the 10,167 Cinema theatres in India.[2]
